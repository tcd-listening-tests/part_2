      name: Blind Grading Phase - Part 2
      content: >         
        The aim of the blind grading phase is to rate the quality of each stimulus compared to a reference recording, under a number of specific criteria. Please note that the reference recording represents the most accurate representation of the original source signal that is presented, and you should base your quality judgements on how closely the test signals match the reference, under the following criteria. <br/><br/>
        Test Criteria and Attributes <br/><br/>
        SOURCE DISTANCE – how closely the perceived distance of the test signals matches the perceived distance of the given reference.<br/>
        ENSEMBLE WIDTH – how closely the perceived spatial width of the entire ensemble, containing multiple sources, matches the perceived width of the given reference <br/>
        SPATIAL IMPRESSION / ENVELOPMENT – how the closely the perception of being surrounded or enveloped by the reproduced sound, and the overall sense of spaciousness of the test signals, matches that of the given reference. <br/>
        TIMBRE – how closely the timbral quality (tone colour bright-dark, full-thin, coloration, etc.) of the test signals match that of the given reference. <br/>
        NATURALNESS / PRESENCE – how closely the perceived naturalness of the scene and the degree to which you feel physically present in the scene, matches that of the given reference. <br/><br/>
        Each trial will contain 5 signals to be graded. You should listen to the reference, and all the test items by clicking on the respective buttons.  <br/>
        You may listen to the signals in any order, any number of times.  <br/> <br/>
        Use the slider for each signal to indicate your opinion of its quality under the given heading. When you are satisfied with your grading of all signals you should click on the “Next” button at the bottom of the screen. 
        The grading scale is a continuous scale, divided into 5 general tiers; “Excellent”, "Good", "Fair", "Poor", “Bad”.  <br/> <br/>
        In evaluating the sound excerpts, please note that you should not necessarily give a grade in the “bad” category to the sound excerpt with the lowest quality in the test.
        However one (or more) excerpts must be given a grade of 100 because the unprocessed reference signal is included as one of the excerpts to be graded.
        Please listen to entire sample before starting playback a different recording.  <br/><br/>

        Pressing "next" will take you to the first question of part two of this test, which contains 14 questions. <br/> <br/> 
        Once you are happy with your responses, click the "next" button to continue to the next page. You may press the back button to return to any previous test if needed.  <br/> <br/>
        Please note that at least one recording must be rated at 100 before you can proceed to the next page.
        Please evaluate all recordings and not just the ones you deem to be of a high quality. Give each recording a fair score compared to the ideal recording i.e. the reference recording, in terms of the specific attribute being evaluated.
